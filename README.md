Personal Portfolio Website

### Objective
My goal with this website is to make a clean, mobile-first website.
I chose to mix in a variety of different styling techniques to get
a feel for all the tech taught in my Full-Stack Web Development class.
This was a nice opportunity, because I had never created an entire
website on my own before.
