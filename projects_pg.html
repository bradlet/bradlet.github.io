            <h5>Scope</h5>
            <p class="focused">
              This project was sponsored by a man named Todd, who is the manager
              at International Paper Specialty Ink and Plate Division
              (Beaverton, OR).
              <b>The issue:</b> his company's auditing practices were very
              outdated. All audits across all departments were still done in
              paper. The focus for our project was their housekeeping
              department, where an inability to keep track of issues via audits
              could lead to a potentially dangerous environment.
              <i>For example,</i> if an Automatic Electronic Defribrillator
              (AED) was missing signage, causing it to be unfound, and someone
              was having a medical emergency, then the missing signage could
              very well be the difference between life and death.
            </p>
            <h5>Our Solution</h5>
            <p class="focused">
              CilantroAudit is a cross-platform application that allows admins
              to create new audits, which users can fill out and send to the
              database. Both admins and users can then quickly retrieve complete
              audits from the database to view, as well export to PDF or Excel.
              Our software also insures that multiple employees won't complete
              the same exact audit via a lockout feature, and allowed admins to
              track flagged-issue trends over time - making it much easier to
              find urgent problems that need resolution. Our number-one focus
              for UI development was ease-of-use, because the target audience
              was a less technologically-savvy demographic.
            </p>
            <h5>Dev Team</h5>
            <p class="focused">
              In this project, I worked with a team of 8 other capstone students
              following an agile development model. We maintained modern coding
              practices, followed the PEP-8 Python coding standard, the builder
              OO pattern, and implemented well-documented and well-tested code.
              The result: a maintanable, expansible software solution.
