          <h5>Scope</h5>
          <p class="focused">
            This project was sponsored by a man named Todd, who is the manager
            at International Paper Specialty Ink and Plate Division
            (Beaverton, OR).
            <b>The issue:</b> his company's auditing practices were very
            outdated. All audits across all departments were still done in
            paper. The focus for our project was their housekeeping
            department, where an inability to keep track of issues via audits
            could lead to a potentially dangerous environment.
            <i>For example,</i> if an Automatic Electronic Defribrillator
            (AED) was missing signage, causing it to be unfound, and someone
            was having a medical emergency, then the missing signage could
            very well be the difference between life and death.
          </p>
          <h5>Our Solution</h5>
          <p class="focused">
            CilantroAudit is a cross-platform application that allows admins
            to create new audits, which users can fill out and send to the
            database. Both admins and users can then quickly retrieve complete
            audits from the database to view, as well export to PDF or Excel.
            Our software also insures that multiple employees won't complete
            the same exact audit via a lockout feature, and allowed admins to
            track flagged-issue trends over time - making it much easier to
            find urgent problems that need resolution. Our number-one focus
            for UI development was ease-of-use, because the target audience
            was a less technologically-savvy demographic.
          </p>
          <h5>Dev Team</h5>
          <p class="focused">
            In this project, I worked with a team of 8 other capstone students
            following an agile development model. We maintained modern coding
            practices, followed the PEP-8 Python coding standard, the builder
            OO pattern, and implemented well-documented and well-tested code.
            The result: a maintanable, expansible software solution.
